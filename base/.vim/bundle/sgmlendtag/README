This sgml end tag completion plugin aims to provide a simple
means to complete end tags in sgml documents (xml, html, etc.).

Unlike some other end tag completion plugins, the end tag is
not auto added when you finish typing the opening tag, but
instead is inserted only when you start typing the closing tag
(when you hit the slash in '</'), at which point the tag name
and closing > are inserted automatically.

The intent of this approach is to prevent an interruption in
your flow of typing by not requiring you to ever have to
navigate around text added to the right of the cursor.
