INTRODUCTION                                     *reporoot* *reporoot.vim*

The reporoot plugin provides a single command that attempts to find the
nearest repository root and change the directory to it.

It also provides some functions that are useful in other scripts.

The supported VCS types are Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, and Subversion.

COMMANDS                                         *reporoot-commands*

:RepoRoot[!]                                     *:RepoRoot*
    Change directory to the root of the source code repository. If [!] is
    used, then don't consider the current directory when checking for the
    presence of a repository.

FUNCTIONS                                        *reporoot-functions*

IsRepo({expr})                                   *IsRepo()*
    Returns true if the passed {expr} is a recognized VCS repository. If
    {expr} is a file, it will first get the directory before testing.

GetRepoRoot({expr})                              *GetRepoRoot()*
    Returns the root directory of the {expr}'s repository. If it's not a
    repository, the {expr} will be returned unchanged.

GetRepoName({expr})                              *GetRepoName()*
    Returns the name of the {expr}'s repository. Currently this is just the basename of
    the repository root directory.

GetRepoRelative({expr})                          *GetRepoRelative()*
    Returns the path of the given file or directory relative to the repository
    root directory.

CONFIGURATION                                    *reporoot-configuration*

g:reporoot_loaded                                *g:reporoot_loaded*
    If set in your |vimrc|, reporoot.vim is not loaded.
